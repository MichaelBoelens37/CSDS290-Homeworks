----------Description-------------

For our 6th and final assignment, we were instructed to download Unity's 2D gamekit and design 3 different, original levels. The levels are meant to be increasingly difficult to "beat" where the last level should take multiple tries to beat. While I used most of the 2D game mechanics, I added some of my own as well. For example, I added the damager component to a block, so when a block drops on an enemy, it will get crushed and die. I also added a damager to the feet of the main character so you can jump on enemies to kill them.
