# HW2 & HW3
--------Description----------

Our second and third homework assignments were to adjust a basic 3D shooter game, then add custom assets, sound affects, and textures. 


For HW2 (Intro to Unity 3D: A Simple 3D Game), we were given a pretty bare template for a 3D shooting game. We had to make adjustments to it, for example. when we shot at the enemies, the enemy quickly rotated to 75 degrees in one frame. I adjusted this so that the enemies rotate to 90 degrees in a more smooth pattern. The map was also very small and bare, so we were instructed to increase the playing field. I also had to implement the fact that after an enemy is eliminated, it will increase the number of enemies in the game arena by one. So, everytime an enemy is killed, 2 more spawn in. I also instantiated tomb stones for after the enemies are hit, and they rotate endlessly and the player cannot actually interact with the tombstone. Finally, I added a health indicator and a game over screen for when the player is shot at too many times.

For HW3 (3D Assets, Textures, and Sound), we built off of our project from homework two. We were instructed to add custom assets, a custom sky box, sound affects, and a particle system. I thought it would be cute to make the walls as trees, so I made it sort of a forest type game. I thought it would be funny to have little slimes shooting hamburgers so I found assets on the Unity Assets store and uploaded those. I added a particle system to the enemies walking as well as the enemies shooting. For sound, I added a somewhat relaxing but mysterious ambiance in the background. On top of that, I implemented sound for when an enemy shoots and when an enemy is killed.
