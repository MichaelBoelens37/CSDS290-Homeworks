In this assignment you will design, create, and test a text adventure game with approx. 20 minutes of playtime in groups of 4 students using the Quest Engine. Your team may use concepts from HW1 Part I, combine concepts, or design a brand new concept.

Create an account on the Quest website
If Quest has a bug preventing account creation, try your Google login
Option 1) Create a Google account for your team and login with that to use the web interface
Option 2) Login with an existing Google account and download the off-line Windows Quest editor and share the project file with your team
If your team runs into other issues with the Quest website editor, the standalone editor may be more reliable. This is a Windows program, but can be run in Mac using Bootcamp or virtual machines such as VM Ware Fusion (free on CWRU Software Center) or Oracle Virtual Box. Windows 10 Education can also be downloaded from the CWRU Software Center.
To export a game from the standalone editor to the website, you must select the "Publish" option under the "Tools" menu, which will create a ".Quest" file, which can be uploaded to the Quest website.

Go through the Quest Tutorial

Finalize a Game Design Document, which can be based on one from HW1 Part I or write a new one that you developed as a team, an example text adventure design doc is available in modules

Paper Design: As a team, design and play your game layout on paper, including puzzles, solutions, and other game elements, which will be submitted

Write out any text needed for your game, such as introductory text that is given to the player at the start of the game and descriptions of characters, objects, puzzles, or rooms. This can be in a separate document simply for design purposes.

Implement the game in Quest web interface or Windows application. Development using the Quest GUI is all that is required. Scripting enables more, such as typewriter effects, but is not required. It is recommended that your team develop in the Text Adventure mode if your  game requires object/character/map interactions, as the Storybook mode has limited functions and is more appropriate for "choose-your-own-adventure" type stories.

Publish the game as an “Unlisted Game” and determine the game URL.

Playtest: Have at least five friends who are not currently taking EECS 290 playtest the game and provide feedback about the game and revise it accordingly. Keep a log of their names, emails, completion times, and feedback to submit as part of your assignment. Also document what changes you made in response to feedback or rationale for not doing so.
