# HW5: 3D Avatar Animation

--------Description-----------

For homework 5 we were given a basic first person shooter game. We were instructed to modify the game so that the camera angle is 3rd person, and moves along with the movement of the mouse. We additionally had to import a custom palyer Avatar. Using mixamo, I found and uploaded a character that I thought looks like she can take on zombies. I then downloaded animations and added 5 animation states: idle, jumping, shooting, walking, and dancing. I then created the "zombie army" by creating a for loop that generates 10 zombies in random locations throughout the map. Once all of the zombies are killed, a little message shows up and there is a play again or quit button. And then, the last part of the assignment was to use a custom executable icon. I chose a little zombie image. To access the rubric for this assignment, click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6CiPOk2zEm_TzfqhCzUVmQpTRtSDT0-/view?usp=sharing).
